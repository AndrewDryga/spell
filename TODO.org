* TODO Websocket Transport

I've been having trouble with gun -- it errors silently. With gun's new [[https://github.com/ninenines/gun/commit/8366ba94bb9e450221a246acdd482c0162affcd9][tracing]]
hopefully this will be easier. I'd like to stick with gun because it fits the
persistently connected model, and it's shaping up to be a great library.

- [X] spec out the transportable protocol
